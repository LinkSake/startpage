# LinkSake's Startpage

Minimal startpage based on several startpages I saw on [r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/comments/12bobou/my_first_custom_start_page/).

## Sections

- Search: Simple search input that redirects your query to DuckDuckGo.
- Date and time: Current time and date.
- Weather: Request to [wttr.in](https://wttr.in/) to get the current weather on my city.
- Links: Some frequently accesed links.
- Poem: Request to [PoetryDB](https://poetrydb.org/index.html) to get a random short poem.
- Art: Some ASCII Art of a paper crane.

## Live Demo

## TODOs

- Make the art displayed random, haven't found an existing db or api of ascii art yet.
